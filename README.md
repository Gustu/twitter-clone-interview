# REST API - Twitter clone

## User stories
* As a user I can add a tweet
  * Tweet contains a message and author information
  * Tweet message limit is 255 chars
* As a user I can delete my tweet
  * User can delete a tweet within 3 minutes from publication
* As a user I can read all tweets (“News Feed”)
  * Sorted from latest to oldest

## Rules & tips
* No user interface is necessary
* No actual integration with Twitter is necessary
* Use ES6 or TS
* We’ll want to see at least unit tests for the code
* Solution should be stored in a public repository or sent to us in a zip archive
* Please provide a README with application requirements and setup instructions
* Your application could be publicly available (nice-to-have). You can use Heroku for that

Treat above scope, rules & tips as the minimum. Feel free to enhance your solution further.
